<h1>Hackers Hacking in a Hackerspace</h1>

<p>Sometimes I think we forget how good we have it in the Rails world.  I don my ruby-colored slippers to work every morning and it&lsquo;s easy to forget this wasn&lsquo;t always the case.  I was recently reminded of this dark past when our <a href="http://austinhackerspace.org">local hackspace</a> needed to write some database-backed web software.</p>

<p>If I was hanging out with my Ruby friends, this is the moment that the cool ones (myself included) suggest we use Sinatra.  Sure, it doesn&lsquo;t ship with an ORM, but you can try out a new one!  And despite Rails being leaps and bounds more capable of leaping and bounding than other frameworks out there, Sinatra has an elegance factor that appeals to me.  There&lsquo;s a certain joy from building complex things out of simple components.</p>

<p>However, I was not in Ruby land.  I was at a hackerspace.  Sinatra is that guy who sings New York, New York and Ruby is seen as a to-be-tested improvment upon Perl.  Gross.</p>

<p>So a discussion inevitably comes up as to which framework to use.  To my shock, Rails does not come up as a winner: being a lingua franca, they debate Java and <em>eventually choose PHP</em>.  Great.  It&lsquo;s going to be a flame war.</p>

<p>I found myself in a common dilemma: having used Ruby frameworks, PHP frameworks, and Java frameworks I was in a clear position to argue for a winner.  But this is not a situation for arguments becuase winning one would require everyone else to have the same level of knowledge.  I can talk for hours to the Java people about how Ruby&lsquo;s objects just "make sense", or the PHP people about how you can still use all your dirty little tricks.  However, so long as they think I am making these arguments for the sole purpose of convincing them, which is half true, arguments are useless.</p>

<p>Instead of despairing we opted to use competition.  We would take a week and the PHP team could work its magic while I got to be the lone member of team Ruby.  After coding up a <a href="http://github.com/csquared/cerberus_prox_sinatra_old">single-file frontend in Sinatra</a> I was more than prepared to shock and awe everyone with what we could do with Ruby.  Instead, I had to listen to the benefits of the Zend Framework.</p>

<p>The Zend fucking Framework.  I fail.  I showed up with a knife to a gun fight.</p>

<p>And at first, I was legitimately scared.  However, these are engineers.  <em>We&lsquo;re not going for elegance, we&lsquo;re going for features</em>.  And yet as this realization dawned on me while the show-and-tell continued, I realized I already had this figured out.  Zend Framework is so productive, you can generate a form from an array.  Imagine that.  A whole form out of just a little array.   I&lsquo;ll see your Zend Framework, and I&lsquo;ll raise you RAILZ 3!!</p>

<p>So yes, this is a story about how using Rails 3 made me a badass.  Because for a brief moment, it did.  That night I went home and <code>rails generate</code>-d my way into a fully functional frontend.  Psh.  An array to build a form.  I was up and going in an evening, despite some issues with the legacy schema.</p>

<p>After generating the backend, I moved to deploy over working on features.  This step was crucial, and something you can only do in software.  In the real world if you want a bigger boat, you&lsquo;re gonna need a bigger boat.  You can&lsquo;t just tell your current boat to double itself.  In the digital world we have this ability and that&lsquo;s why its important to deploy quickly and often.  By building the entire pipeline to your users, it overcomes the prototype phase by forcing the app to perform or perish.</p>

<p>It turned out the ability to iterate quickly was what gave Rails the edge in our quick battle of the frameworks.  The cerberus-prox project updated its database schema.  One migration, one commit, and one deploy and my app was already running on the updated database.  At this point, the <a href="http://www.github.com/csquared/cerberus-prox-frontend">Cerberus Prox Frontend</a> was moved to port 80, where it still remains.  A testament to deploying early, iterating often, and just doing what works instead of debating it.</p>

<p>At a the first <a href="http://austinrb.org">Austin.rb</a> meeting, we were asked what we like about Ruby.  This is what I like about Ruby.  It grants a level of control over the machine that once took a great many lines of subtle syntax.  Ruby either makes you dumber or unleashes your creativity.  Perhaps a little of both, which is probably what makes it so damn fun.</p>
