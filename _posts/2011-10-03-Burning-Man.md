After many years of wondering just what that thing in the desert is, I finally made it to Burning Man.

Although the experience is still effecting me, I have definitely taken away a few insights.

## Gifts > Bartering

You may be surprised that no money is exchanged during Burning Man.
Yet there are still Bars, food vendors, and late night popcorn - for free, from complete strangers.
If this were a barter world I would perhaps offer my shirt, or a chicken.
But this isn&amp;quot;t.  Take the popcorn, it is yours.

In a gift economy you are not expected to immediately return a favor or item with an item of equal value.
Instead, it is like a communal game of paying it forward.
Unless you are part of the minorty of sociopaths, recieving a true gift: where nothing is expected in return, can be a gratifying and transformative experience.
It creats a moment of good will, which has been shown in theory and in practice to lead to other people mimicking this behavior.
In a way when someone gives you a true gift you are expected to return that gift, but not to the giver and not right away.
The proof that this gift is unconditional is that there is no law to enforce this.

Well, lets step back for a minute.  There may be no &quot;law&quot; in the cops-and-robbers sense, but fuck that shit anyways.
Or in more technical terms: just because there is no overtly enforcable law does not lead to anarchy, merely a different type of order.
In a way its an experiment in radical scalability, something I see in the abstract on a regular basis.

For instance, the first requirement for a gift is a surplus.  
And if you remember, its not like one can just exploit the natural resources of the desert.
So you need to live in the kind of world where people can have a surplus.
This, in a way, shows how this type of gift economy does not seek to displace our everyday world of buying in selling, but holds a (sometimes ugly) mirror to its motivations and results.
It is a like a foreground-background relationship.  That thing in the desert has meaning because there
is a much more sober world surrounding it.  

Yet I think without a space for true lawlessness, even if only for a wekk, the inertia of the dead ruling the living
is unbearable.
By burning the man, it creates space for each year&lsquot;s new man.
