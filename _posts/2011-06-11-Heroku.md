{{ page.title }}
================

Now that I&lsquo;ve [crossed all the ts and dotted all the lower case js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryicgd_hJ44)
I can let everyone know: I&lsquo;m going to be working at [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) starting
this July!

I&lsquo;m very excited about this opportunity.  There is so much to learn and also so much work to
do making Heroku the world-class plaftorm that it is.  I&lsquo;m going to be on the add-ons team,
building out the functionality and interfaces that some of you will be using to provide your own
services to Heroku customers.

I think Heroku&lsquo;s newest iteration, the "Cedar" stack, is the quantum leap forward for not merely hosting 
a web application, but allowing it to dynamically scale.
