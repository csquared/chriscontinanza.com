title: A Cheap and Easy Laptop Stand
---

{{ page.title }}
================

I'm a nomad programmer, a bedouin, and often find myself working at cafes.  At the
end of a particularly cafe-heavy week I found myself with an awful 
tension headache due the miserable ergonomics of sitting down and staring
at a laptop.  At home I can use my standing desk, but I'm yet to find a
cafe where I can stand and code.  

Here's what I did about it:

Super-simple design: two triangles (with feet at the bottom) connected by a piece
of wood.  I notched the connections but it worked fine without them.  The white
stuff is some foam I had around.

And here it is out in the wild:

I plan on this version being a prototype, and am hoping the folks at the local
hackerspace can help me with a metal or plastic version.  However, this first
draft already works and is shitty enough to inspire you to make your own,
better one.  Hack on!
