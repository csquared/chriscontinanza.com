================

After many years of wondering just what that thing in the desert is, I finally made it to Burning Man. Although the experience is still affecting me, I have definitely taken away a few insights.

## Gifts > Bartering

You may be surprised that no money is exchanged during Burning Man.
Yet there are still Bars, food vendors, and late night popcorn - for free, from complete strangers.
If this were a barter world I would perhaps offer my shirt, or a chicken.
But this isn&rsquo;t the barter system: this is a gift economy.  Take the popcorn, it is yours.

In a gift economy you are not expected to immediately return a favor or item with an item of equal value.
Instead, it is like a communal game of paying it forward.
Unless you are part of the minorty of sociopaths, recieving a gift where nothing is expected in return can be a transformative experience.
Normally one&rsquo;s first reaction is to return a similar gift.  

However, this is rarely the case in the desert.  Because money is banned, you
you have take your immediate desire to close the transaction and instead
sublimate the drive towards giving something else away to someone else,
maybe even at a much later time.
The calculus is no longer a two-party exchange. 
Instead, the community of givers creates an open-ended network of exchange.

## Laws of Supply

The first requirement for a gift is a surplus and one can&rsquo; just exploit the natural resources of the desert.

This means any type of gift economy does not seek to displace our everyday world of private property, even if it holds a (sometimes ugly) mirror to its motivations and results.
It is a like a foreground-background relationship.  
Only having resources in our supposed normal world is the very thing that enables
you to have gifts to give away.  

In other words, the gift economy is not even an alternative to our current system.
It can give it meaning beyond mere consumption and greed.
Having to share is better just than having to have.
At least in my opinion.
