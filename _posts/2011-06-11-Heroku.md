================

Now that I&lsquo;ve [crossed all the ts and dotted all the lower case js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryicgd_hJ44)
I can let everyone know: I&lsquo;m going to be working at [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) starting
this July!

I&lsquo;m very excited about this opportunity.  There is so much to learn and also so much work to
do making Heroku the world-class plaftorm that it is.  I&lsquo;m going to be on the add-ons team,
building out the functionality and interfaces that some of you will be using to provide your own
services to Heroku customers. The add-ons are like an app marketplace -- allowing your web app to consume other cloud services through Heroku.

I think Heroku&lsquo;s newest iteration, the "Cedar" stack, is the quantum leap forward for not merely hosting 
a web application, but allowing it to dynamically scale.  The first iterations of the Heroku Platform ironed out deploying a Rails app to the cloud.  With Cedar, we&lsquo;re working towards running any unix process with the same simplicity and scalability as our current applications.

That said, I&lsquo;ve begun putting my money where my mouth is and have started transitioning my sites to Heroku. [ First off, this site!](http://chriscontinanza.heroku.com/2011/06/15/Jekyll-to-heroku.html)

Stay tuned, as I will be posting code to github and transitioning all of an add-on I built for Heroku to run on the new Cedar stack.
